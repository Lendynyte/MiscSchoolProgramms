MiscSchoolProgramms
===================

Just some codes i use during lectures

This is just storage for my project that I create during my learning of programming.
Usually just some random codes mainly java/c#/c that I am too lazy to create own repo for
nothing special really
also I comment in mix of Czech and English language so it's just a mess
